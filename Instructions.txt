06.03.01 - Hash Table
Implement a HashTable.java file that allows a user to store and retrieve items using a key value 
pair. The keys should be hash values of the values which will be objects.
Requirements - 
– Your table must operate in roughly O(1) for insert, delete and search operations.
– You may choose the collision handling system that appeals to you (your options are linear, 
  quadratic, buckets, etc.)
- You must initialize your table as an array (what you store in the array is up to you) 
  meaning you’ll need to decide on the size of your array. We can use this to see how many 
  collisions we get. There’s no specific requirement for what size you choose, but your code 
  should work if we decide to change the size later.
- You should use the hashCode function already present in the String class. Note that this 
  function can return negative values and may be larger than the size of your table so you 
  should use the absolute value and also modulo the result by your table size.
String key = "hello"; 
int hashCode = key.hashCode();
int arrayIndex = Math.abs(hashCode) % tableSize;
– I’ve implemented a save and load function into your starter code that allows you to save and 
  load your table into a file so you can store it for later (pretty useful if you want to 
  actually use this as an application). I would recommend you take a look at that code briefly 
  to see what’s going on there.

–My code relies on an Iterator called keys. An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop 
 over data structures. It is an interface that requires the following be implemented:

default void    forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action)
    Performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements have been processed or 
    the action throws an exception.

boolean     hasNext()
    Returns true if the iteration has more elements.

E       next()
    Returns the next element in the iteration.

default void    remove()
    Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by this iterator 
    (optional operation).


You will have to implement all of these although you may simply have “forEachRemaining” and 
“remove” throw an error if they are called since we won’t have a use for them in this project.

What is actually scored:
– You’ve implemented your table as an ARRAY not an ArrayList or something else that takes up 
  more space and requires more than O(1) to access/search.
- public void put(String key, Object value) puts an item into the hashtable. If there are two 
  items with exactly the same key the old one should be replaced with the new one.
- public String get(String key) find an element with the specified key in the table and return 
  it’s value 
- public String remove(String key) remove the element with the specified key, if none exist 
  return null, otherwise return the value removed.
– public Iterator keys() This iterator should be able to retrieve the next key in your hashtable.
  Note that specifically this part of your program is not going to be O(1) while the above 
  should be relatively close to it. That means you SHOULD NOT use the iterator inside the above 
  methods, it should only be used for the save and load functions already provided as well as 
  the print function described below.
- public void print() - use the iterator to iterate through the hashTable and System.out.println 
  all the key value pairs. Each key value pair should go on it’s own line.
